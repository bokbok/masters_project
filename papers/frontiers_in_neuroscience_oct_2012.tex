\begin{abstract}
The burst suppression pattern is well recognized as
a major class of generalised electroencephlagram (EEG) waveform abnormality 
and is evoked by a variety of anesthetic agents. 
While the electroencephalographic phenomenon and clinical
implications of burst suppression have been studied extensively, the physiological mechanisms
underlying its emergence remain unresolved and obscure. 

While the model of Liley et. al. has been shown to account for many of the major features of the 
mammalian electroencephlagram, because of a strong coupling between excitatory and inhibitory population dynamics,  
it is unlikely to display burst suppression. This is because of the inability of simulated anesthetic action 
to induce the dynamics on multiple timescales that underlie bursting.
However the addition of a mean field driven slow wave system to the Liley model introduces 
multiple timescale behavior to the Liley model.

The extended Liley model is shown to exhibit burst suppression under physiologically 
plausible parameterisations for anesthesia with a wide variety of bursting behavior. 
This paper provides an overview of such dynamics and their relevance for a more 
complete physiological understanding of the EEG.

\section{Introduction}
Prior to the development of the modern intensive care unit in the early
1960s, featuring intubation, artificial respiration and comprehensive
physiological monitoring, reports of the electroencephalographic
pattern of burst suppression were confined to animal studies involving
deep anaesthesia and the odd case of psychosurgery (Niedermeyer,
2009). Since then the burst suppression pattern is now recognized as
a major class of generalised EEG waveform abnormality of diagnostic
and prognostic significance that is encountered in a range of
encephalopathic conditions, in addition to its pharmacological genesis
by a variety of sedative and anaesthetic agents. Typically the burst
suppression pattern consists of bursts of high amplitude slow, sharp or
spiking activity electroencephalographic activity separated by periods
of electroencephalographic suppression (isoelectricity). The oscillatory
features of the bursts, together with their duration and the duration of
suppressed periods show a high degree of variability that reflects its
myriad of initiating causes (see Figure 1 for examples). First identified
during deep anaesthesia with tribromoethanol in cats (Derbyshire et al,
1936), labelled “burst-suppression pattern” by Swank \& Watson (1948) during barbiturate and ether anaesthesia in dogs, it is now
associated with cortical deafferentation (Henry \& Scoville, 1952),
cerebral anoxia and hypoxia, various types of intracortical lesions
(Fischer-Williams, 1963), deep coma, various infantile
encephalopathies, the final stages of deteriorated status epilepticus
(Trieman et al 1990), hypothermia, and high levels of many sedative
and anaesthetic agents (Schwartz et al, 1989; Akrawi et al 1996).

Burst suppression in the absence of anaesthesia is in general
associated with a very poor prognosis. Grigg-Damberger et al (1989)
found that the neonatal appearance of burst suppression, even if
transient, was a portent of death or severe neurodevelopmental
disability in 93\% of infants who were followed up subsequent to the
appearance of electroencephalographic evidence of neonatal burst
suppression. In adult populations while an anoxic/hypoxic burst
suppression pattern signals a serious pathophysiological event the
outcome is not necessarily fatal and recovery with or without severe
neurological damage is possible (Niedermeyer, 2009). The results of
experimental work with EEG monitoring in rats reveals that animals with
greater rates of high amplitude bursts had a better survival and
neurological outcome compared to those with lower rates of low
amplitude bursts (Geocadin et al, 2002).

While the electroencephalographic phenomenon and clinical
implications of burst suppression have been studied extensively
(Niedermeyer, 2009; Brenner, 1985) the physiological mechanisms
underlying its emergence remain unresolved and obscure. However the
phenomenal resemblance of the patterns of burst suppression to
disorders of neuronal hyperexcitability suggests that similar
physiological mechanisms may be at root. For example the bursting
during burst suppression is often associated with myoclonic jerks
resembling those seen during epileptic fits. Further, during burst
suppression induced by various halogenated anaesthetic agents, bursts
can be readily evoked by auditory, visual or somatosensory stimuli
(Hartikainen et al, 1995). Like generalised epileptiform activity, bursts
are recorded simultaneously at multiple electrode derivations, implying
the wide synchronisation of neuronal activity. Not surprisingly then, in
clinical practice the boundaries between what constitutes coma
induced burst suppression and what is defined as ictal seizure activity
is blurred (Amzica, 2009; Hirsch et al, 2004). While such
differentiation may be one of only semantics practically speaking there
nevertheless may be important clinical implications if they respond
differentially to pharmacotherapy and have different prognostic
outcomes, thus motivating attempts to better clarify such a
distinction.

Surprisingly many anaesthetic agents, at levels well below that needed
to induce burst suppression, quite commonly induce epileptiform
activity (Voss et al, 2008). While such epileptiform activity rarely
progresses to clinically apparent seizures (Garcia-Morales et al, 2002)
the presence of such activity nevertheless is believed to indicate some
form of incipient cortical hyperexcitability. Indeed a number of
mesoscopic mean field models developed to account for the
electroencephalographic features of anaesthetic action (Bojak \& Liley,
2005; Steyn-Ross et al, 1999), based on parameterising empirically
identified sub-cellular and molecular targets, have been able to account
for the pro-convulsant properties of many anaesthetic agents known
to have seizurogenic potential (Wilson et al, 2006; Liley \& Bojak,
2005). Given that the majority of anaesthetic agents induce burst
suppression it is therefore natural to inquire whether these mesoscopic
mean field models of electrocortical anaesthetic action are able to
account for the appearance of drug-induced burst suppression, and in
doing so shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms of burst
suppression and epilepsy in general.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Mesoscopic mean field modelling of electrocortical activity}
The electroencephalogram and electrocorticogram arise out of the
cooperative activity of many thousands of neurons. A single
electroencephalographic electrode records the synaptically induced
currents of well over a 100,000 neurons (Nunez \& Srinivasan, 2006)
and thus detailing each neurons contribution to this summed activity
would appear superfluous. For this reason it is preferable instead to
model the activity of populations of neurons. One general way of
achieving this, in which known stochastic fluctuations can be included,
is to dynamically evolve the probability distributions associated with
the states of the neuronal ensemble. While in principle providing a
rigorous way forward the formulation of such stochastic equations of
motion entails a great deal of physiological uncertainty. For this and
other reasons (Deco et al, 2008) a more resolute path is to
dynamically evolve some average quantity such as the mean soma
membrane potential or the mean firing rate of some suitably defined
neuronal ensemble. In this manner a mesoscopic level model can be
developed which acts as a bridge between cellular (or microscopic)
level activity and whole brain (or macroscopic) level behaviour.
While the current mathematical approach for formulating the equations
of motion for the activity of neuronal populations or masses, stems
principally from the works of Wilson \& Cowan (1973, 1972), Nunez
(1974), Freeman (1975) and Amari (1975, 1977), they are not
particularly successful in articulating the genesis of rhythmic activity in
the EEG and its modulation by pharmacological agents, due to a range
of mathematical simplifications that cannot be justified by an appeal to
physiology. For this reason a range of biologically more refined
neuronal populations models have been developed (Deco et al, 2008)
that form a more appropriate basis from which to model the
physiological genesis of the electroencephalogram. The model of Liley
et al (2005; 2003; 2002; 1999) is one such model and will be the
focus of our attempts to account for the phenomenon of burst
suppression.

The model of Liley et al (2011; 2005; 2003; 2002; 1999) is able to
account for the major features of the mammalian
electroencephalogram in the context of a parameterisation that
accords with physiological measurement and experiment. Because it
aims to provide a dynamical description of the electroencephalogram
the model is spatially coarse-grained over the approximate extent of a
cortical macrocolumn, reflecting the general physiological wisdom that
such columniation signifies populations of neurons having similar
functional behaviour and anatomical connectivity. The multiple
interactions between individual neurons are replaced by effective feedforward
and feed-back interactions between the mean activity (or
“mean fields”) of excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons over
the spatial extent of the column. In this way mammalian neocortex is
conceived as consisting of localized populations of excitatory and
inhibitory neurons interacting by all possible combinations of
feedforward and feedback connectivity interacting globally via long
range excitatory connections (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Schematic overview of the essential intracortical and corticocortical
interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal
populations in the model of Liley et al (2011; 2005; 2003; 2002;
1999). Figure reproduced with permission from Liley et al (2011).
Following conductance based approaches typically used to model
networks of synaptically interacting networks of individual model
neurons, excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations are modeled as
single passive resistive-capacitive compartments into which all
synaptically induced postsynaptic currents flow. Functionally these
populations are equivalent to the excitatory and inhibitory KO sets of
Freeman’s (1975) K-set hierarchy. Cortical activity is then described
by the mean soma membrane potentials of the spatially distributed excitatory ($h_e$)
and inhibitory ($h_i$) neuronal populations. The connection with pysiological measurement is obtained through $h_e$, which is
assumed to be linearly related to the surface recorded
electroencephalogram (Nunez \& Srinivasan, 2006; Freeman, 1975).
Thus the response of the mean soma membrane potential $h_k$ ($k=e,i$) at position $r$ on a two dimensional cortical sheet, to induce post synaptic activity $I_{lk}$ ($l$=source, $k$=target population) is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:h_k} 
\tau_k\frac{\partial h_k(r,t)}{\partial t} = h^r_k - h_k(r,t) + \sum_{l=e,i} \frac{h_{lk}^{eq} - h_k(r, t)}{\left| h_{lk}^{eq}-h_k^r\right|}I_{lk}(r,t) 
\end{equation}

The postsynaptic response to a single pre-synaptic action potential (at
t = 0) is modeled by the well-known synaptic alpha function of cable
theory as $\Gamma_{lk} \gamma_{lk}texp(1-\gamma_{lk}t), t \geq 0$ and is excitatory or inhibitory depending
on the sign of $\Gamma_{lk}$ (peak amplitude), and thus we assume that the time
course of the synaptically induced excitatory and inhibitory currents is
described by a critically damped oscillator driven respectively by the
mean rate of incoming excitatory and inhibitory axonal pulses:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:i_lk}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \gamma_{lk} \right)^2 I_{lk}(r,t) = exp(1)\Gamma_{lk}\gamma_{lk}.A_{lk}(r,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a_ek}
A_{ek}(r,t) = N_{ek}^{\beta} S_e[ h_e(r,t)] + \phi_{ek} p_{ek}(r,t),  A_{ik}(r,t) = N_{ik}^{\beta} S_i[h_i(r,t)] + p_{ik}(r,t)
\end{equation}

where $A_{lk}$ comprises the different sources of presynaptic spikes: $N_{lk}^\beta S_i$ (input from local cortical neuronal populations), $\phi_{ek}$ (input from long range excitatory cortico-cortical fibres) and $p_{lk}$ (extracortical sources).
While the present consensus is that extracortical sources
(thalamocortical afferents) are purely excitatory in nature and thus $p_{ik} \cong 0$0, we choose to keep these terms as they enable the effects of
tonic inhibition to be included without the need to define additional
parameters. The time courses of the synaptically induced currents, $1 / \gamma_{lk}$ are taken to describe the time course of ‘fast’ excitatory ($l = e$: $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) \& kainate) and inhibitory ($l=i$: $\gamma$-amino-butyric-acid type A (GABA\textsubscript{A}) neurotransmitter kinetics. Mean neuronal population firing rates, $S_l$, are assumed to to instantanious sigmoid functions of the mean soma membrane potential i.e

\begin{equation} \label{eq:s_l}
S_l[h_l(r,t)]=S_l^{max}/\{1 + exp[\sqrt{2}(h_l(r,t)-\mu_l)/\sigma_l]\}
\end{equation}

The axonal pulses $\phi_{ek}$ propagated by the exclusively excitatory long
range cortico-cortical fibre system is in the simplest case described by
the following two-dimensional telegraph equation,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi}
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + v_{ek} \Lambda_{ek} \right)^2 \phi(r,t) - \frac{3}{2} v_{ek}^2 \bigtriangledown^2\phi(r,t)=v_{ek}^2 \Lambda_{ek}^2 N_{ek}^\alpha S_e[h_e(r,t)]
\end{equation}

where $N_{ek}^\alpha$ is the total number of excitatory connections formed by
long range cortico-cortical axons on long on local population $k$, and
assumes a single axonal conduction velocity $v_{ek}$ and and an exponential fall
off with distance (characteristic scale = $1/\Lambda_{ek}$) of the strength of
cortico-cortical connectivity. For simplicity, and given the fact that in
anaesthesia burst suppression involves the whole brain, we choose to
only study the spatially homogeneous case i.e. $\bigtriangledown^2 = 0$

Equations (\ref{eq:h_k}, \ref{eq:i_lk}, \ref{eq:a_ek} \& \ref{eq:phi}) represent a system of 8 coupled non-linear partial
differential equations that typically defines the Liley model of
electrocortical rhythmogenesis, which is capable of reproducing the
main features of spontaneous human electroencephalogram (alpha
resonance, '$1/f$' activity). Table \ref{table:model_params} summarises all model parameters,

assumed to be physiologically admissible. Table adapted from Liley et

\subsection{Model parameterisation: generation of normative parameter sets}
Because burst suppression activity (at least that caused by
anaesthetic and sedative action) is assumed to ultimately arise out of
a background of normal electroencephalographic activity it is
important to define parametrically normative states in order to study
how they may be perturbed during health and disease. We therefore
choose to utilize previously defined parameter sets (Bojak \& Liley,
2005) that have the following properties: i) are confined to the
physiologically admissible parameter space (see Table 1), ii) give rise
to electroencephalographically and physiologically plausible activity
('1/f' decay at low frequencies plus a relatively sharp peak at alpha
frequencies, 8 – 13 Hz; mean excitatory/inhibitory neuronal firing rates
< 20 s-1) and iii) that exhibit transient increases in total power and
monotonic reductions in mean frequency with respect to modeled
anaesthetic action (see below). In general such sets are found by
randomly searching the high dimensional physiologically admissible
(and plausible) parameter space. For further details see Bojak \& Liley
(2005).

\subsection{Extending mean field models to account for the molecular and subcellular
actions of anaesthetic agents}
A great deal of information is available regarding the molecular and
sub-cellular sites of anaesthetic action, with many of these identified
sites able to be mapped to parameters in the Liley model (see Table
2). Given that the majority of anaesthetic agents (for exceptions see
below) induce burst suppression, the parametric subspace defined by
anaesthetic action is the obvious place to begin explorations into the
pathophysiological mechanisms and implications of burst suppression.
As shown in Bojak \& Liley (2005) in order to better account for the
effects that many anaesthetics have on the time course of inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials a simple extension of the synaptic alpha
function, which allows independent adjustments of the rise (defined by $1/\gamma_{lk}$)
and decay times (determined by $\epsilon_{lk}$) is required i.e.

$\Gamma_{lk}\gamma_{lk} \frac{exp\left\{\epsilon_{lk}/(1-exp[-\epsilon_{lk}])\right\} }{exp[\epsilon_{lk}] - 1}.\{exp[-\epsilon_{ek}\gamma_{lk}/(exp[\epsilon_{lk}] - 1) - exp[-\epsilon_{ek}\gamma_{lk}/(1 - exp[-\epsilon_{lk}])]\}$
\\
where $\epsilon_{lk} \ge 0$ and where the limit $\epsilon_{lk} \rightarrow 0$ reduces to the previously
defined synaptic alpha function. The corresponding differential
equation is then (Liley et al, 2011; Bojak \& Liley, 2005):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:i_lk_aug}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \tilde{\gamma_{lk}}exp[\epsilon_{lk}] \right)^2 I_{lk}(r,t) = \Gamma_{lk}\tilde{\gamma_{lk}}exp[\epsilon_{lk} + \tilde{\gamma_{lk}}/\gamma_{lk}].A_{lk}(r,t)
\end{equation}
\\
where $\tilde{\gamma_{lk}} = \epsilon_{lk}\gamma_{lk}/(exp[\epsilon_{lk} - 1])$. The relationship between $\epsilon_{lk}$ and the decay time from peak $(\varsigma)$ while monotonically increasing, can in general only
be determined numerically.

\subsection{Investigating and incorporating speculative physiological
mechanisms of burst suppression}
While it is often assumed that burst-suppression pattern arises from
slow thalamic oscillations driving cortex (Fisch, 1999), the fact that
this pattern persists subsequent to cortical deafferentation instead
suggests that it is an intrinsic dynamical feature of cortical tissue
(Luktach et al, 1995).
While many anaesthetic agents, at sufficiently high doses, are capable
of producing burst suppression pattern electroencephalogram, not all
do. Pharmacologically, anaesthetics that induce burst suppression all
seem to have a GABAergic profile, even if weak. One that has not
been reported to induce burst suppression, xenon, is widely believed to
act principally via the antagonism of glutamatergic neurotransmission.
Indeed it is reported in laboratory slice preparations that burst
suppression induced by thiopental, propofol and isoflurane requires the
maintenance of glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission
(Luktach et al, 2005). While NMDA antagonists have been shown to
reduce burst duration and amplitude in slice preparations (Kroeger \&
Amzica, 2007), in clinical practise antiepileptic drugs generally show
poor response.
Lukatch \& MacIver (1996) report that burst suppression appears to
result from the direct activation of GABA-gated Cl– channels as
muscimol, a potent selective GABAA agonist, reliably induces this
phenomenon. Therefore perturbation of GABAergic neurotransmission
may be key to understanding the pathophysiology of burst
suppression. Such a view is also supported by work involving
hippocampal slices subject to simulated ischemia in which it is found
that ischemia releases GABA initially by exocytosis and then by
reversal of a high affinity GABA plasma membrane transporter (GAT-1;
Allen et al, 2004).
The implied importance of GABAergic inhibitory processes is also
supported by the work of Steriade et al (1994) in which they found
that hyperpolarisation of the resting cell membrane potential of
cortical neurons reliably preceded conspicuous electroencephalographic
aspects of burst suppression. However in addition to inhibitory
GABAergic contributions they also ascribed the hyperpolarisation to i)
thalamic disfacilitation ii) inactivation of a variety of inward ionic
currents and iii) increases in membrane K+ conductances.
While maintenance of a sufficient level of glutamate-mediated
excitatory neurotransmission is required for the genesis of the bursting
in burst suppression, there is nevertheless evidence that
neurotransmission in general is attenuated. For example Kroeger \&
Amzica (2007) showed that bursting depleted interstitial Ca2+ to a
level incompatible with synaptic transmission, and speculate that this
accounts for the isoelectric suppression period. That attenuated
neurotransmission may also be involved in the genesis of hypoxia
induced burst suppression is supported by the works of Endemli and
Crunelli (1998), in which they found that brief periods of anoxia can
cause a total, but reversible loss of synaptic transmission, and
Fleidervish et al (2001), in which it was found that hypoxia depleted
readily releasable pools of vesicles for transmitter release.
On the basis of the available evidence regarding the pathophysiology
of burst suppression we will therefore confine ourselves to a
parametric subspace comprising alterations in the strength of excitatory neurotransmission 
($\Gamma_{ee},  \Gamma_{ei}$), variations in the strength and kinetics of inhibitory neurotransmission ($\Gamma_{ii},  \Gamma_{ie}, \epsilon_{ii}, \epsilon_{ie}$),
and alteration in subcortical drive ($p_{lk}$).

\subsection{Theoretical basis of busrting}
Fast slow dynamics....

\subsection{Physiological Observations of Bursting in EEG}
Up/down states. Slow wave etc

\subsection{Limitations with the current model}
Inability to operate on multiple time scales. Phase locking of excitatory/inhibitory subsystems


\subsection{Extensions to Liley Model to facilitate slow wave dynamics}
To account for cortical up and down states an expression for the resting potential $\tilde{h}_k^{rest}$ must be formulated to include a slow wave driven
deviation ($\zeta_{k}$) from the average resting potential, $h_k^{rest}$. This is expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h_k_aug}
\tilde{h}_k^{rest}=h_k^{rest} + \rho_k\zeta_k
\end{equation}
where $\rho_k$ is a constant



With equation (\ref{eq:h_k}) then becoming
\begin{equation} \label{eq:h_k_aug} 
\tau_k\frac{\partial h_k(r,t)}{\partial t} = \tilde{h}^{rest}_k - h_k(r,t) + \sum_{l=e,i} \frac{h_{lk}^{eq} - h_k(r, t)}{\left| h_{lk}^{eq}-h_k^r\right|}I_{lk}(r,t) 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simple decoupled second order system system}

\subsection{First order mean field driven slow system}
$h_k^{slow}$ is assumed to be driven by deviations of the mean field ($h_k$) from its average resting potential $h_k^{rest}$. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:h_k_slow} 
\frac{\partial \zeta_k}{\partial t} = \mu_k^{slow}(h_k - h_k^{rest}) - \nu_k^{slow}\zeta_k
\end{equation}
with $\mu_k^{slow}, \nu_k^{slow}$ being time constants specifying 'charge' and 'discharge' times respectively.

\section{Introduction}
Prior to the development of the modern intensive care unit in the early
1960s, featuring intubation, artificial respiration and comprehensive
physiological monitoring, reports of the electroencephalographic
pattern of burst suppression were confined to animal studies involving
deep anaesthesia and the odd case of psychosurgery (Niedermeyer,
2009). Since then the burst suppression pattern is now recognized as
a major class of generalised EEG waveform abnormality of diagnostic
and prognostic significance that is encountered in a range of
encephalopathic conditions, in addition to its pharmacological genesis
by a variety of sedative and anaesthetic agents. Typically the burst
suppression pattern consists of bursts of high amplitude slow, sharp or
spiking activity electroencephalographic activity separated by periods
of electroencephalographic suppression (isoelectricity). The oscillatory
features of the bursts, together with their duration and the duration of
suppressed periods show a high degree of variability that reflects its
myriad of initiating causes (see Figure 1 for examples). First identified
during deep anaesthesia with tribromoethanol in cats (Derbyshire et al,
1936), labelled “burst-suppression pattern” by Swank \& Watson (1948) during barbiturate and ether anaesthesia in dogs, it is now
associated with cortical deafferentation (Henry \& Scoville, 1952),
cerebral anoxia and hypoxia, various types of intracortical lesions
(Fischer-Williams, 1963), deep coma, various infantile
encephalopathies, the final stages of deteriorated status epilepticus
(Trieman et al 1990), hypothermia, and high levels of many sedative
and anaesthetic agents (Schwartz et al, 1989; Akrawi et al 1996).

Burst suppression in the absence of anaesthesia is in general
associated with a very poor prognosis. Grigg-Damberger et al (1989)
found that the neonatal appearance of burst suppression, even if
transient, was a portent of death or severe neurodevelopmental
disability in 93\% of infants who were followed up subsequent to the
appearance of electroencephalographic evidence of neonatal burst
suppression. In adult populations while an anoxic/hypoxic burst
suppression pattern signals a serious pathophysiological event the
outcome is not necessarily fatal and recovery with or without severe
neurological damage is possible (Niedermeyer, 2009). The results of
experimental work with EEG monitoring in rats reveals that animals with
greater rates of high amplitude bursts had a better survival and
neurological outcome compared to those with lower rates of low
amplitude bursts (Geocadin et al, 2002).

While the electroencephalographic phenomenon and clinical
implications of burst suppression have been studied extensively
(Niedermeyer, 2009; Brenner, 1985) the physiological mechanisms
underlying its emergence remain unresolved and obscure. However the
phenomenal resemblance of the patterns of burst suppression to
disorders of neuronal hyperexcitability suggests that similar
physiological mechanisms may be at root. For example the bursting
during burst suppression is often associated with myoclonic jerks
resembling those seen during epileptic fits. Further, during burst
suppression induced by various halogenated anaesthetic agents, bursts
can be readily evoked by auditory, visual or somatosensory stimuli
(Hartikainen et al, 1995). Like generalised epileptiform activity, bursts
are recorded simultaneously at multiple electrode derivations, implying
the wide synchronisation of neuronal activity. Not surprisingly then, in
clinical practice the boundaries between what constitutes coma
induced burst suppression and what is defined as ictal seizure activity
is blurred (Amzica, 2009; Hirsch et al, 2004). While such
differentiation may be one of only semantics practically speaking there
nevertheless may be important clinical implications if they respond
differentially to pharmacotherapy and have different prognostic
outcomes, thus motivating attempts to better clarify such a
distinction.

Surprisingly many anaesthetic agents, at levels well below that needed
to induce burst suppression, quite commonly induce epileptiform
activity (Voss et al, 2008). While such epileptiform activity rarely
progresses to clinically apparent seizures (Garcia-Morales et al, 2002)
the presence of such activity nevertheless is believed to indicate some
form of incipient cortical hyperexcitability. Indeed a number of
mesoscopic mean field models developed to account for the
electroencephalographic features of anaesthetic action (Bojak \& Liley,
2005; Steyn-Ross et al, 1999), based on parameterising empirically
identified sub-cellular and molecular targets, have been able to account
for the pro-convulsant properties of many anaesthetic agents known
to have seizurogenic potential (Wilson et al, 2006; Liley \& Bojak,
2005). Given that the majority of anaesthetic agents induce burst
suppression it is therefore natural to inquire whether these mesoscopic
mean field models of electrocortical anaesthetic action are able to
account for the appearance of drug-induced burst suppression, and in
doing so shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms of burst
suppression and epilepsy in general.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Mesoscopic mean field modelling of electrocortical activity}
The electroencephalogram and electrocorticogram arise out of the
cooperative activity of many thousands of neurons. A single
electroencephalographic electrode records the synaptically induced
currents of well over a 100,000 neurons (Nunez \& Srinivasan, 2006)
and thus detailing each neurons contribution to this summed activity
would appear superfluous. For this reason it is preferable instead to
model the activity of populations of neurons. One general way of
achieving this, in which known stochastic fluctuations can be included,
is to dynamically evolve the probability distributions associated with
the states of the neuronal ensemble. While in principle providing a
rigorous way forward the formulation of such stochastic equations of
motion entails a great deal of physiological uncertainty. For this and
other reasons (Deco et al, 2008) a more resolute path is to
dynamically evolve some average quantity such as the mean soma
membrane potential or the mean firing rate of some suitably defined
neuronal ensemble. In this manner a mesoscopic level model can be
developed which acts as a bridge between cellular (or microscopic)
level activity and whole brain (or macroscopic) level behaviour.
While the current mathematical approach for formulating the equations
of motion for the activity of neuronal populations or masses, stems
principally from the works of Wilson \& Cowan (1973, 1972), Nunez
(1974), Freeman (1975) and Amari (1975, 1977), they are not
particularly successful in articulating the genesis of rhythmic activity in
the EEG and its modulation by pharmacological agents, due to a range
of mathematical simplifications that cannot be justified by an appeal to
physiology. For this reason a range of biologically more refined
neuronal populations models have been developed (Deco et al, 2008)
that form a more appropriate basis from which to model the
physiological genesis of the electroencephalogram. The model of Liley
et al (2005; 2003; 2002; 1999) is one such model and will be the
focus of our attempts to account for the phenomenon of burst
suppression.

The model of Liley et al (2011; 2005; 2003; 2002; 1999) is able to
account for the major features of the mammalian
electroencephalogram in the context of a parameterisation that
accords with physiological measurement and experiment. Because it
aims to provide a dynamical description of the electroencephalogram
the model is spatially coarse-grained over the approximate extent of a
cortical macrocolumn, reflecting the general physiological wisdom that
such columniation signifies populations of neurons having similar
functional behaviour and anatomical connectivity. The multiple
interactions between individual neurons are replaced by effective feedforward
and feed-back interactions between the mean activity (or
“mean fields”) of excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons over
the spatial extent of the column. In this way mammalian neocortex is
conceived as consisting of localized populations of excitatory and
inhibitory neurons interacting by all possible combinations of
feedforward and feedback connectivity interacting globally via long
range excitatory connections (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Schematic overview of the essential intracortical and corticocortical
interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal
populations in the model of Liley et al (2011; 2005; 2003; 2002;
1999). Figure reproduced with permission from Liley et al (2011).
Following conductance based approaches typically used to model
networks of synaptically interacting networks of individual model
neurons, excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations are modeled as
single passive resistive-capacitive compartments into which all
synaptically induced postsynaptic currents flow. Functionally these
populations are equivalent to the excitatory and inhibitory KO sets of
Freeman’s (1975) K-set hierarchy. Cortical activity is then described
by the mean soma membrane potentials of the spatially distributed excitatory ($h_e$)
and inhibitory ($h_i$) neuronal populations. The connection with pysiological measurement is obtained through $h_e$, which is
assumed to be linearly related to the surface recorded
electroencephalogram (Nunez \& Srinivasan, 2006; Freeman, 1975).
Thus the response of the mean soma membrane potential $h_k$ ($k=e,i$) at position $r$ on a two dimensional cortical sheet, to induce post synaptic activity $I_{lk}$ ($l$=source, $k$=target population) is given by

\begin{equation} 
\tau_k\frac{\partial h_k(r,t)}{\partial t} = h^r_k - h_k(r,t) + \sum_{l=e,i} \frac{h_{lk}^{eq} - h_k(r, t)}{\left| h_{lk}^{eq}-h_k^r\right|}I_{lk}(r,t) 
\end{equation}

The postsynaptic response to a single pre-synaptic action potential (at
t = 0) is modeled by the well-known synaptic alpha function of cable
theory as $\Gamma_{lk} \gamma_{lk}texp(1-\gamma_{lk}t), t \geq 0$ and is excitatory or inhibitory depending
on the sign of $\Gamma_{lk}$ (peak amplitude), and thus we assume that the time
course of the synaptically induced excitatory and inhibitory currents is
described by a critically damped oscillator driven respectively by the
mean rate of incoming excitatory and inhibitory axonal pulses:

\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \gamma_{lk} \right)^2 I_{lk}(r,t) = exp(1)\Gamma_{lk}\gamma_{lk}.A_{lk}(r,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A_{ek}(r,t) = N_{ek}^{\beta} S_e[ h_e(r,t)] + \phi_{ek} p_{ek}(r,t),  A_{ik}(r,t) = N_{ik}^{\beta} S_i[h_i(r,t)] + p_{ik}(r,t)
\end{equation}

where $A_{lk}$ comprises the different sources of presynaptic spikes: $N_{lk}^\beta S_i$ (input from local cortical neuronal populations), $\phi_{ek}$ (input from long range excitatory cortico-cortical fibres) and $p_{lk}$ (extracortical sources).
While the present consensus is that extracortical sources
(thalamocortical afferents) are purely excitatory in nature and thus $p_{ik} \cong 0$0, we choose to keep these terms as they enable the effects of
tonic inhibition to be included without the need to define additional
parameters. The time courses of the synaptically induced currents, $1 / \gamma_{lk}$ are taken to describe the time course of ‘fast’ excitatory ($l = e$: $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) \& kainate) and inhibitory ($l=i$: $\gamma$-amino-butyric-acid type A (GABA\textsubscript{A}) neurotransmitter kinetics. Mean neuronal population firing rates, $S_l$, are assumed to to instantanious sigmoid functions of the mean soma membrane potential i.e

\begin{equation}
S_l[h_l(r,t)]=S_l^{max}/\{1 + exp[\sqrt{2}(h_l(r,t)-\mu_l)/\sigma_l]\}
\end{equation}

The axonal pulses $\phi_{ek}$ propagated by the exclusively excitatory long
range cortico-cortical fibre system is in the simplest case described by
the following two-dimensional telegraph equation,

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + v_{ek} \Lambda_{ek} \right)^2 \phi(r,t) - \frac{3}{2} v_{ek}^2 \bigtriangledown^2\phi(r,t)=v_{ek}^2 \Lambda_{ek}^2 N_{ek}^\alpha S_e[h_e(r,t)]
\end{equation}

where $N_{ek}^\alpha$ is the total number of excitatory connections formed by
long range cortico-cortical axons on long on local population $k$, and
assumes a single axonal conduction velocity $v_{ek}$ and and an exponential fall
off with distance (characteristic scale = $1/\Lambda_{ek}$) of the strength of
cortico-cortical connectivity. For simplicity, and given the fact that in
anaesthesia burst suppression involves the whole brain, we choose to
only study the spatially homogeneous case i.e. $\bigtriangledown^2 = 0$

Equations (1-4) represent a system of 8 coupled non-linear partial
differential equations that typically defines the Liley model of
electrocortical rhythmogenesis, which is capable of reproducing the
main features of spontaneous human electroencephalogram (alpha
resonance, '$1/f$' activity). Table 1 summarises all model parameters,
their definitions and approximate ranges.

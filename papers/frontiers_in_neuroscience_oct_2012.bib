abstract="The burst suppression (BS) pattern of the EEG was originally described as a response to large dosages of anesthetics and sedatives. It was subsequently found over/in isolated cortex due to surgical procedures or lesions underlying the cortex. Around 1960 with the introduction of modern intensive care treatment (intubation, artificial respiration) the BS pattern has become a typical EEG correlate of cerebral anoxia. These obvious consequences of this therapeutic approach with their impact on the EEG picture are more or less inexplicable. The BS pattern is also typical in two rare and severe central nervous system (CNS) disorders in infants: early infantile myoclonic encephalopathy (EIME) and Ohtahara syndrome.",

abstract ={The electroencephalograms of seven elderly (70–85 years) and seven younger patients (23–31 years) anesthetized with a concentration of isoflurane sufficient to produce burst suppression were studied. Anesthesia in these unpremedicated subjects was induced by inhalation of nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and oxygen. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine and the lungs were next ventilated with oxygen and isoflurane to produce an end-tidal concentration of 1.7%. Isoflurane concentration was determined by infrared analysis of expired gas collected from a Teflon catheter inserted through the endotracheal tube. After 25 minutes at steady state, the EEG was recorded for 5 minutes prior to surgical stimulation. Arterial blood pressure, temperature, and ventilation were maintained at normal values. In elderly patients the EEG had both a greater proportion of total time in electrical silence (76.0 ± 10.8% vs 37.6 ± 15.4%; P < 0.01) and a greater number of isoelectric periods (19.7 ± 8.1 vs 10.7 ± 5.4; P < 0.05). This demonstrates a discrete alteration with age in the central nervous system sensitivity to isoflurane.},

abstract="Electroencephalogram (EEG) burst-suppression can be produced with several anesthetic agents. Discussions of burst-suppression suggest that it has been viewed by many as a relatively uniform physiologic state independent of the agent used to produce it. This view may be an oversimplification. In this study, relatively deep EEG burst-suppression (suppression to burst time ratio, 4:1) was induced in rats with isoflurane (I), thiopental (T), etomidate (E), and propofol (P). Burst duration, maximum peak-to-peak voltage, area under the curve, and the ratio of power in high versus low frequencies of EEG recorded in both cortex and subcortex (thalamus) were determined. Analysis of the bursts revealed significant differences in duration [I, 1.4 +/- 0.4 (SD); T, 0.8 +/- 0.5; E, 0.3 +/- 0.1; P, 0.4 +/- 0.1 seconds], peak-to-peak voltage (I, 488 +/- 146; T, 285 +/- 106; E, 310 +/- 87; P, 249 +/- 50 muV), and area under the curve (I, 111 +/- 24; T, 35 +/- 31; E, 17 +/- 7; P, 21 +/- 4 muV-s) for all agent pairs except etomidate and propofol. Suppression phase analysis revealed considerable residual activity with all four agents, although peak-to-peak voltage (I, 129 +/- 29; T, 64 +/- 20; E, 62 +/- 11; P, 40 +/- 15 muV) and area under the curve (I, 73 +/- 17; T, 37 +/- 14; E, 30 +/- 5; P, 22 +/- 10 muV-s) were greatest with isoflurane. The cortical versus subcortical comparison revealed, for all agents, greater peak-to-peak voltage and area under the curve in the subcortex. The data indicate that the electrophysiologic characteristics of burst-suppression vary among the four agents, with the possible exception of etomidate and propofol. The data suggest that the neurophysiologic states associated with burst-suppression produced by various anesthetics should not be assumed to be uniform.",

abstract ={The true incidence of seizures caused by general anesthetic drugs is unknown. Abnormal movements are common during induction of anesthesia, but they may not be indicative of true seizures. Conversely, epileptiform electrocortical activity is commonly induced by enflurane, etomidate, sevoflurane and, to a lesser extent, propofol, but it rarely progresses to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Even “nonconvulsant” anesthetic drugs occasionally cause seizures in subjects with preexisting epilepsy. These seizures most commonly occur during induction or emergence from anesthesia, when the anesthetic drug concentration is relatively low. There is no unifying neural mechanism of anesthetic drug-related seizurogenesis. However, there is a growing body of experimental work suggesting that seizures are not caused simply by “too much excitation,” but rather by excitation applied to a mass of neurons which are primed to react to the excitation by going into an oscillatory seizure state. Increased ?-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition can sensitize the cortex so that only a small amount of excitation is required to cause seizures. This has been postulated to occur 1) at the network level by increasing the propensity for reverberation (e.g., by prolongation of the “inhibitory lag”), or 2) via different effects on subpopulations of interneurons (“inhibiting-the-inhibitors”) or 3) at the synaptic level by changing the chloride reversal potential (“excitatory GABA”). On the basis of applied neuropharmacology, prevention of anesthetic-drug related seizures would include 1) avoiding sevoflurane and etomidate, 2) considering prophylaxis with adjunctive benzodiazepines (a-subunit GABAA agonists), or drugs that impair calcium entry into neurons, and 3) using electroencephalogram monitoring to detect early signs of cortical instability and epileptiform activity. Seizures may falsely elevate electroencephalogram indices of depth of anesthesia.},

abstract="Summary : The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical aspects in 130 patients presenting periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in their EEG and to compare these results with those found in the literature. Etiology, neurologic deficit, seizure occurrence, and evolution were studied in each patient by historical review. The recordings were obtained on 8- or 16-channel EEGs with electrode placement according to the International 10-20 System. Recordings containing PLEDs were selected. PLEDs were defined as repetitive periodic, focal, or hemispheric epileptiform discharges (spikes, spike and waves, polyspikes, sharp waves) usually recurring every 1 to 2 seconds. The statistical study was carried out via the [chi]2 test using the computer program SPSS. The main etiology found in this group of patients was stroke (61 of 130 patients). Other processes found were brain infections, tumors, hematomas, and several other entities grouped together as miscellaneous (anoxic encephalopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, craniocerebral trauma, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis, and aminophylline intoxication). Half of these patients (65 of 130) developed seizures, mostly partial motor seizures. No significant relation between etiology and seizures was found ([chi]2 = 2.81, P = 0.4222). Seizures recurred in 14 of 130 patients during a follow-up of 14.5 months. PLEDs were not recorded in any EEG at the time of seizure recurrence. PLEDs constitute a distinctive but uncommon EEG phenomenon of repetitive, periodic, and stereotyped lateralized complexes. In agreement with the literature, PLEDs were associated with an acute process and occurred early during the course of the illness in all patients studied and were usually associated with structural lesions, with stroke being the main etiology. Traditionally, seizures occur with PLEDs but it is also accepted that they can exist in patients who never develop epileptic activity, either clinically or electrically, as demonstrated in 50\% of the patients studied. No significant association between seizures and any etiology could be found. It was not demonstrated that the occurrence of seizures may influence the outcome in any way.

abstract="Summary: A central difficulty in modeling epileptogenesis using biologically plausible computational and mathematical models is not the production of activity characteristic of a seizure, but rather producing it in response to specific and quantifiable physiologic change or pathologic abnormality. This is particularly problematic when it is considered that the pathophysiological genesis of most epilepsies is largely unknown. However, several volatile general anesthetic agents, whose principle targets of action are quantifiably well characterized, are also known to be proconvulsant. The authors describe recent approaches to theoretically describing the electroencephalographic effects of volatile general anesthetic agents that may be able to provide important insights into the physiologic mechanisms that underpin seizure initiation.
